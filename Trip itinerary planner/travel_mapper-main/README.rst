Prompt Engineering for Trip Itinerary Planning to LLMs through In-context Learning

This project seeks to enhance the capabilities of OpenAI models like ChatGPT for trip planning tasks requiring complex spatiotemporal reasoning.
While these large language models show promise, they currently struggle with consistently providing accurate, creative,
and personalized responses to queries about planning customized travel itineraries subject to various constraints.
Our goal is to improve context-awareness, accuracy, and adaptability of responses by employing techniques like prompt engineering to structure queries,
in-context learning to provide relevant examples, and integra2ng geographic data sources.

Execution steps:
1. pip install -r requirements.txt --user
2. export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)
3. Go to the directory of the folder
3. travel_mapper/user_interface/driver.py
